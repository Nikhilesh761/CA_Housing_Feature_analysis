#California Housing- Feature Relationships
##key findings
**Income patterns**:Higher Income= More rooms per Household
**Density hotspots**: Coastal areas show highest population density
**Age Distribution**: Most homes built between 10-40 years old
**occupancy**:average 2.8 persons per household

## Progress (Week 1)
- Data loading and initial exploration
- Spatial distribution mapping
- Next: Income pattern analysis
## week 2
## MONDAY
- ## Machine Learning Insights
### Corrected Coastal Analysis
- **Income Impact**: $354 increase per $1k income
- **Actual Coastal Premium**: $82,500 (validated visually)
- **Model Limitation**: Linear regression can't capture complex geography
### Lesson Learned
"Initial attempt to quantify coastal premium failed due to:
- Oversimplification of geographical features
- Linear model limitations for spatial patterns
- Need for advanced feature engineering"

- ## WEDNESDAY
- # Validation Report (Walidation - polish)

- **Business impact:**
- Average error: $49,314 (11.5% improvement)

- Methodology valid for:
- Kuala Lumpur high-rises(Malaysia)
- Warsaw residential districts (Poland)
